## Black Friday Sales Prediction
This project has been divided into 3 notebooks, each accomplishing a different task of the project. Please view these notebooks in the respective order stated below.
1. [Black Friday Data Cleaning](https://github.com/Puru35/Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction/blob/master/Black_Friday_Data_Cleaning_.ipynb)
    * Contains the Description of the project, the data cleaning and pre-processing of the dataset. Import the [train.csv](https://github.com/Puru35/Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction/blob/master/train.csv) dataset for this notebook.
2. [Black Friday Visualization](https://github.com/Puru35/Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction/blob/master/Black_Friday_Visualization_.ipynb)
    * This Notebook contains the visualization of the various features of the dataset. Import the [train.csv](https://github.com/Puru35/Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction/blob/master/train.csv) dataset for this notebook.
3. [Black Friday Model Training]()
    * This is the final notebook that contains the various models trained, and the final conclusion of the project. Import the [Black Friday Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/Puru35/Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction/blob/master/Black%20Friday%20cleaned%20Data%20set.csv) dataset for this notebook.
    
Each of these links takes you to the respective notebooks, which can be viewed in Google Colab. All of the required csv files have been provided in the repository, along with the "test" dataset that I have not implemented.

## Conclusion
To view the final conclusion, view the last segment of the [Black Friday Model Training]() notebook.
